								<p style="text-align:justify"> The deployment of a mobile service robot in
									domestic settings is a challenging task due to the dynamic and
									unstructured nature of such environments. Successful operation
									of the robot requires continuous human supervision to update
									its spatial knowledge about the dynamic environment. Thus, it
									is essential to develop a human-robot interaction strategy that is
									suitable for novice end users to effortlessly provide task-specific
									spatial information to the robot. Although several approaches
									have been developed for this purpose, most of them are not
									feasible or convenient for use in domestic environments. In
									response, we have developed an augmented reality (AR) spatial
									referencing system (SRS), which allows a non-expert user to tag
									any specific locations on a physical surface to allocate tasks to
									be performed by the robot at those locations. Specifically, in the
									AR-SRS, the user provides a spatial reference by creating an AR
									virtual object with a semantic label. The real-world location of
									the user-created virtual object is estimated and stored as spatial
									data along with the user-specified semantic label. We propose
									three different approaches to establish the correspondence
									between the user-created virtual object locations and the realworld
									coordinates on an a priori static map of the service area
									available to the robot. </p>
