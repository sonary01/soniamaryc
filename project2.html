									<!--</header> -->
								<p style="text-align:justify"> This is a novel augmented reality (AR) 
									interaction method that allows a robot to perform
									manipulation of unknown physical objects in a human-robot
									collaborative working environment. A mobile AR application
									is developed to determine and communicate, in real-time, the
									position, orientation, and dimension of any random object in
									a robot manipulatorâ€™s workspace to perform pick-and-place
									operations. The proposed method is based on estimating the
									pose and size of the object by means of an AR virtual element
									superimposed on the live view of the real object. In particular,
									a semi-transparent AR element is created and manipulated
									through touch screen interactions to match with the pose and
									scale of the physical object to provide the information about
									that object. The resulting data is communicated to the robot
									manipulator to perform pick-and-place tasks. In this way,
									the AR virtual element acts as a medium of communication
									between a human and a robot. The performance of the proposed
									AR interface is assessed by conducting multiple trials with
									random objects, and it is observed that the robot successfully
									accomplishes tasks communicated through the AR virtual
									elements.</p>
