								<p style="text-align:justify"> Sharing the intention of a robot is essential to
									engender confidence in and guarantee safety of humans while
									they work in a robot co-located environment. It is a challenging
									task to share information about a robotâ€™s intent and state,
									for example its planned motion, internal data, and sensory
									information, in a timely and comprehensible manner with users
									who may be engaged in other activities. Visual cueing offers
									an effective way to mediate intent and state communication
									between robots and humans and augmented reality (AR)
									provides a common canvas to share visual cues in a realworld environment. In this work, we present a mobile AR
									application to display navigation information of a mobile robot.
									We explored the potential of exhibiting motion intent of a
									mobile robot using AR visualization and examined how it
									improves the situational awareness (SA) of users. Our empirical
									studies illustrate that AR visualization is effective and beneficial
									for humans to better understand the actions of robots and hence
									improve their SA in a working environment where robots and
									humans coexis. </p>
